Description:
------------
This GitHub repository contains a website that acts as a business card for potential employment or a source of my creative outputs. The website was created from scratch and will continue to be built upon over many versions with increasingly complex codes as I pursue along my coding journey. 

Goals:
------
> In the foreseeable future, after building this repository with many projects, 
> I plan to ship my personal website to a fully own domain.

1. Add projects to portfolio
2. Enumerate website with more complex user friendly interactions
3. Ship repository to personal domain
